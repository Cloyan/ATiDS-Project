# ATiDS-Project
**Project Description:**
In this project, we seek to build a model that is proficient in distinguishing between grayscale images of stars and galaxies. We seek to accomplish this by acquiring a dataset from Kaggle and then applying some basic augmentation techniques before feeding the resulting dataset for training to existing models as well as experimental models we create from those models.  
**Repository and code structure:**
This repository contains the following: this README file and an ipynb file containing the code of this project. The code is in Python and has the following structure:  
- Preparing data and importing and installing necessary packages
- Data preprocessing and metrics
- Model Implementation
  - Base Models
  - Experimental Models
- Model Training
  - Base Models
  - Experimental Models
- Model Evaluation
  - Base Models
  - Experimental Models
**Executing the code:**
To run the notebook in commandline, first install "runipy" with  
pip install runipy  
Then go to the directory of the notebook and run with the following  
runipy Code.ipynb
**Results:**
